# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm start` — Start Expo dev server
- `npm run ios` — Run on iOS
- `npm run android` — Run on Android
- `npm run lint` — Lint with ESLint (expo lint)
- `npm test` — Run Jest in watch mode (`jest --watchAll`)
- `npx jest --testPathPattern=<path>` — Run a single test file

## Architecture

This is a React Native Pokédex app built with **Expo 54**, **Expo Router**, and **TypeScript (strict mode)**. It follows **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture.

### Layer structure (top-down dependency flow)

- **`app/`** — Expo Router file-based routing. Root layout with Stack navigation, routes to list and details pages.
- **`pages/`** — Page compositions that wire together widgets, features, and entities. Each page has its own hooks and components subdirectories.
- **`widgets/`** — Composite UI blocks (e.g., the pokemon list widget).
- **`features/`** — Isolated business features as custom hooks: `load-pokemons` (pagination), `filter-pokemon-list` (debounced search), `fetch-pokemon-by-id`.
- **`entities/`** — Business entities. `pokemon` has `model/` (interfaces), `api/` (fetching + mappers), and `ui/` (PokemonCard).
- **`components/ui/`** — Shared presentational components (Badge, SearchBar, IconButton, PokemonInfo).
- **`shared/api/`** — API layer (currently legacy, to be removed).
- **`shared/lib/`** — Shared utilities: `query-client.ts` (React Query config), `query-keys.ts` (query key factory).
- **`constants/`** — Theme (Material Design 3 colors, fonts).

Each FSD slice exports via `index.ts` public API. Layers only import from layers below them.

### Key patterns

- **Custom hooks** return `{ state, actions }` tuples with memoized values to prevent re-renders.
- **React Query** for server state management with automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates.
  - Query keys follow a hierarchical structure: `pokemonKeys.lists()`, `pokemonKeys.detail(id)`
  - Cache configuration: 5 min stale time (Pokemon data is static), 10 min garbage collection
  - Queries use `useQuery` for single items, `useInfiniteQuery` for paginated lists
- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to project root (configured in `tsconfig.json`).
- **Pokemon types** are classes implementing `PokemonType` interface, each with name, icon, and color theming.

### Testing

Uses `jest-expo` preset with `@testing-library/react-native`. Tests are colocated in `__tests__/` directories alongside source.

**Testing with React Query:**
- Mock API functions at module level using `jest.mock('@/entities/pokemon/api/pokemon-api')`
- Wrap hooks with `createWrapper()` from `@/shared/test-utils/react-query-wrapper`
- Use `renderHook()` with `{ wrapper: createWrapper() }` for proper QueryClient context
- Use `waitFor()` from testing-library to await async state updates
- Each test gets a fresh QueryClient with `retry: false` and `gcTime: 0` for faster tests
